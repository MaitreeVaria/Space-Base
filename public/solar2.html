     <h1>SUN</h1>
     <ul>
      <li>The Sun is the largest object within our solar system, comprising 99.8% of the system’s mass.</li>
<li>The Sun is, at present, about 70% hydrogen and 28% helium by mass everything else ("metals") amounts to less than 2%.</li>
<li>The Sun is located at the center of our solar system, and Earth orbits 93 million miles away from it.</li>
<li>Though massive, the Sun still isn’t as large as other types of stars. It’s classified as a yellow dwarf star.</li>
<li>The Sun's magnetic field spreads throughout the solar system via the solar wind.</li></ul></div>

  <div id="mercury2"></div>
  <div id="mercurytext">
    <h1>MERCURY</h1>
    <ul>

      <li>It is the closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million kilometers) or 0.39 AU.</li>
<li>One day on Mercury takes 59 Earth days. One day-night cycle on Mercury takes 175.97 Earth days. Mercury makes a complete orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
</li>
<li>Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.</li>
<li>Mercury has no moons or rings.</li> </ul>

  <div id="venus2"></div>
    <div id="venustext">
    <h1>VENUS</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>If the sun were as tall as a typical front door, the Earth and Venus would each be about the size of a nickel.</li>
<li>Venus orbits our Sun, a star. Venus is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million km).</li>
<li>One day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days because Venus spins backwards, with its sun rising in the west and setting in the east.</li>
<li>Venus' solid surface is a volcanic landscape covered with extensive plains featuring high volcanic mountains and vast ridged plateaus.</li>
<li>Venus has no moons and no rings.</li>

    <h1>EARTH</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel.</li>
      <li>Earth orbits our Sun, a star. Earth is the third planet from the Sun at a distance of about 93 million miles (150 million km).</li>
<li>A day on Earth is 24 hours. Earth makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Earth time) in about 365 days.</li>
<li>Earth is a rocky planet with a solid and dynamic surface of mountains, canyons, plains and more. Most of our planet is covered in water.</li>
<li>Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other ingredients—the perfect balance to breathe and live.</li>

  <div id="mars2"></div>
      <div id="marstext">
    <h1>MARS</h1>
    <ul>
    <li>If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.</li>
<li>Mars orbits our Sun, a star. Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun at an average distance of about 228 million km (142 million miles) or 1.52 AU.</li>
<li>One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.</li>
<li>Mars is a rocky planet. Its solid surface has been altered by volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.</li>
<li>Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2), argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2), and a small amount of oxygen and water vapor.</li>

  </div>
  <div id="jupiter2"></div>
      <div id="jupitertext">
    <h1>JUPITER</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Eleven Earths could fit across Jupiter’s equator. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be the size of a basketball.</li>
<li>Jupiter orbits about 484 million miles (778 million kilometers) or 5.2 Astronomical Units (AU) from our Sun (Earth is one AU from the Sun).</li>
<li>Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours (a Jovian day), but takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun (a Jovian year).</li>
<li>Jupiter is a gas giant and so lacks an Earth-like surface. If it has a solid inner core at all, it’s likely only about the size of Earth.</li>
<li>Jupiter's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="saturn2"></div>
      <div id="saturntext">
    <h1>SATURN</h1>
    <ul>
     <li> Nine Earths side by side would almost span Saturn’s diameter which doesn’t include Saturn’s rings.</li>
<li>Saturn is the sixth planet from our Sun (a star) and orbits at a distance of about 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers) from the Sun.</li>
<li>Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely) to rotate on its axis once—a Saturn “day”—and 29 Earth years to orbit the sun.</li>
<li>Saturn is a gas-giant planet and therefore does not have a solid surface like Earth’s. But it might have a solid core somewhere in there.</li>
<li>Saturn's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (H2) and helium (He).</li>

<li>Uranus orbits our Sun, a star, and is the seventh planet from the Sun at a distance of about 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers).</li>
<li>Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).</li>
<li>Uranus is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.</li>
<li>Uranus has an atmosphere made mostly of molecular hydrogen and atomic helium, with a small amount of methane.</li>

<li>Neptune orbits our Sun, a star, and is the eighth planet from the Sun at a distance of about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers).</li>
<li>Neptune takes about 16 hours to rotate once (a Neptunian day), and about 165 Earth years to orbit the sun (a Neptunian year).</li>
<li>Neptune is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Pluto is only about 1,400 miles wide. At that small size, Pluto is only about half the width of the United States.</li>
<li>Pluto is about 3.6 billion miles away from the Sun and has five moons.</li>
<li>Pluto’s atmosphere is thin and composed mostly of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.</li>
<li>Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, are so similar in size that they orbit each other like a double planet system.</li>
<li>On average, Pluto’s temperature is -387°F (-232°C), making it too cold to sustain life, but it does have a heart-shaped glacier bigger than Texas.</li>
